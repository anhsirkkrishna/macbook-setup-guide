## About The Project

This project is a single-page, interactive web application designed to guide new users—especially students entering technical fields like Data Science and AI—through the process of setting up a new MacBook.

The goal is to move beyond the factory defaults and create a secure, personalized, and developer-ready workstation. The guide covers:
* Initial setup and system updates.
* Essential security configurations like FileVault and the firewall.
* Personalizing the workflow with Trackpad, Dock, and Finder settings.
* A curated list of essential productivity and development applications.
* A step-by-step walkthrough for setting up a professional coding environment with Homebrew, iTerm2, VS Code, and Python.

This guide was created to be a simple, accessible resource to help every student make their new MacBook the perfect tool for their academic and professional journey.
